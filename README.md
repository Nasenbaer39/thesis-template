# Council Thesis

A [Typst](https://typst.app/) template for final theseses, term papers and similar documents that you can easily customize to fit the requirements of your institution.

## Getting Started

As this template is not available as an official Typst package (yet) the recommended way to use it, is to manually install it into your [typst data directory](https://github.com/typst/packages/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#local-packages) under the local name space. To do so, copy the contents of this repository to `{data-dir}/typst/packages/local/council-thesis/0.1.0`.

Afterwards, you can use the CLI to initialize a project with a default configuration using the following command:

```
typst init @local/council-thesis my-thesis
```

<!--You can use this template in the Typst web editor by clicking "Start from Template" on the dashboard and searching for `council-thesis-template`.

In case you're using Typst locally, you can use the CLI to initialize a project using this template with the following command:

```
typst init @preview/council-thesis-template my-thesis
```-->

This will create a new directory called `my-thesis` with a basic project structure. This also includes the default configuration for the title page and other frontmatter elements.

## Fonts

This template uses the following selection of fonts:

- [IBM Plex Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif)
- [IBM Plex Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans)
- [STIX Two Math](https://online-fonts.com/fonts/stix-two-math)

Because only local usage of this template is possible right now, these fonts have to be installed on your system, which can be done via the links above.

<!--If you use this template locally, you can install the fonts on your system via the links above. In case you're using the Typst web app, all fonts are available out of the box.-->
